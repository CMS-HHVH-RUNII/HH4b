# HH4b
Follow this recipe:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit#ROOT6_SLC6_release_CMSSW_7_4_X

then checkout this directory
cd HH4b/BumpSearchLimitCode
cmsenv
python ProduceWorkspacesHH_13TeV.py

creates bunch of datacards in datacards
and workspaces quite a few workspaces

normally you can then simply run

combine datacards/CMS_jj_HH_2000_13TeV_CMS_jj_4btag_cat0.txt -M Asymptotic -n HH -m 2000

This would produce a root file:

higgsCombineHH.Asymptotic.mH2000.root

that contains a TTree names:

limits;1

In this TTree the values are:

0 :  2 sigma Up
1 :  1 sigma Up
2 :  median
3 :  1 sigma Down
4 :  1 sigma Down
5 :  Observed

And obtain a limit in units of 1 fb. So if you have a limit of  5.8594 it means 5.8594 fb.
The datacard for the moment is simply based on 4btag category. A bit of work would be required to add both categories.
One need to write properly th function MakeDataCard_1Channel in
R2JJFitterHH_13TeV.cc

The Signal trees are located in MiniTrees/Signal_HH and background (QCD MC) in MiniTrees/Background_HH_13TeV.
